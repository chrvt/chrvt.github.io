I am not a fan of new years resolutions. If you want to change something, change it now, don't wait. However, I cannot help but reflecting on what happened in the last year (a lot) and think about the future. 

***

A few weeks ago, I was driving to the other part of Zurich, Switzerland, to pick up some material for insulating walls. Our guest room did not have a door yet and the remaining hole needed to be closed with masonry. I told my flatmate who was driving with me: __"If someone would have told me one year ago that I am going to live with 8 people in a community in Zurich picking up insulating material for my guest room, I would have declared him or her as mentally sick"_. However, here I am. It was a striking realization and yet another manifestation of the only constant of our universe: change. 

I could not help but wonder: If my conditions of life can dramatically change within 1 year, why can't the same happen with our society? Why can't we decrease the wealth gap, increase our efforts to live a sustainable live, develop more trust among each other, move away from a service-costumer relation between state and citizens, don't take the benefits of our modern civilization and democracy for granted? 

This very thought gave me new inspiration to **start again**.
