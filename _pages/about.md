Welcome to my website potential collaborator, friend, teacher or student. I use it to organize my thoughts and current state of my mind on various topics or projects surrouding artificial intelligence, democracry, spirituality, film-making and many more. May I serve you as a spark of inspiration to fuel your [generative drive.](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-tools-and-protocols-for-mental-health) 

I often describe myself as an inveterate democrat. Hence, I am very fortunate to be able to work on my co-founded start-up [Carbon Copy](https://www.carbon-copy.org/) where we try to contribute in solving some of the key challenges of nowadays democracy, in particular political alienation, polaraziation and misinformation.

More conventionally, I have a doctor in philosophy in the area of Artificial Intelligence with a focus on generative modelling. I have a keen interest in a mathematical understanding of these models -  have a look at my [publications](https://chrvt.github.io/publications/). Even though I left academia on August 2023, I still keep one foot into that scholastic door by serving as reviewer for [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) and [ICML](https://icml.cc/).
