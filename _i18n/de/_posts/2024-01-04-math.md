In today's information-driven world, the ability to discern between credible and misleading information is of paramount importance. One significant challenge in this endeavor is the identification of propaganda text, which is designed to manipulate and persuade individuals to adopt specific beliefs or viewpoints, often through deceptive or emotionally charged language. Propaganda can have far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion, shaping political discourse, and even inciting social unrest. Therefore, the development of effective methods for detecting and countering propaganda is essential in maintaining the integrity of information dissemination in the digital age.

The rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT, represents a promising step towards addressing the challenges posed by propaganda. These models, built on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, possess remarkable capabilities in understanding, generating, and analyzing text. They are designed to process vast amounts of textual data, identify patterns, and generate human-like text responses. This enables them to assist in a wide range of tasks, including answering questions, generating creative content, providing language translation, and offering recommendations, among many others.

Large language models like ChatGPT are built upon powerful neural networks that learn from extensive text corpora. They utilize pre-trained knowledge to understand context, syntax, and semantics, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. These models are capable of providing valuable insights into text-based information, which can be leveraged to identify subtle cues and patterns indicative of propaganda.

However, it is crucial to recognize the limitations of these models as well. Large language models like ChatGPT are not infallible, and they have inherent biases that reflect the data they were trained on. These biases can lead to skewed or politically charged responses, which could inadvertently exacerbate the spread of propaganda. Additionally, these models lack genuine understanding and consciousness, operating solely based on statistical patterns in the data. They do not possess critical thinking abilities, ethical judgment, or the ability to validate the accuracy of information. Therefore, while they can be valuable tools, they should be used in conjunction with human judgment and fact-checking mechanisms.

This paper explores the significance of being able to identify propaganda text, particularly in the context of today's digital information landscape. As a main result, we propose an open source application build on ChatGPT coined \textsl{Propaganda Bot} which takes any text as input and conducts a sentiment analysis on it. This sentiment analysis identifies propaganda techniques on each sentence of the input. Crucially, the claissifier is soly based on the ChatGPT-API and thus does not require any additional training, transfer learning or fine tuning. We hope that \textsl{Propaganda Bot} serves as educational tool and source of inspiration for using advanced machine learning to address great issues of societal cohesion such as propaganda. 




How can we turn Chat-GPT, a large language model trained with self-supervision, into a sentiment classifier? First, we need a clear understanding of what sentiments we want the model to classifier. This includes a precise definition of the meaning of each class, that is, of each sentiment. A list of these precise sentiments serves as a context for Chat-GPT. A comprehensive list of propaganda techniques can be found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques

In table 1, we show the sentiments and the explanations we used. 


Then, we simply prompt Chat-GPT to classify the sentence to each of the classes using a 1-hot encoded vectors where each entrance corresponds to the classification confidence. 

Important for seamless integration of the classifier into our Propaganda-Bot pipeline is ensuring that the output has the same structure and data type for each sentence. As straightforward as it may seem, this turned out to be one of the greatest challenges, and required some post-processing of the output.
